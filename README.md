My-JSPM
=======

This is my attempt to solve the two problem you gave me.
I implemented my solution in java.

The solution to first question has two java files. PackageVersion model a version
OrderVersion takes as command line arguments the package version in the semver version format.
It then output a sorted version of it's input.

Question 2 required argument at run time instead of the command line since we want to allow 
the user to test for more than one point in polygone.
